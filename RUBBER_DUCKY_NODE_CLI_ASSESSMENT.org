     prompt: string;
     description: string;
     specialization: string;
     voiceInstructions?: string;
   }
   
   // Leverage CLI's agent management
   class AgentManager {
     async createAgent(definition: AgentDefinition): Promise<Agent>
     async updateAgent(name: string, improvements: string): Promise<Agent>
     async listAgents(): Promise<Agent[]>
     async processWithAgent(agentName: string, content: string): Promise<string>
   }
