* LinkedIn About Section - Version 3 (Grounded & Realistic)

🚧 *Building Better AI Context Engineering Tools*

can.code is developing a context engineering platform to help businesses create 
more effective AI interactions. We're in pre-alpha, focusing on practical tools 
and methodologies for prompt optimization and AI conversation design.

** What We're Building:
🧠 *Context Engineering Sandbox* - Tools for testing and refining AI prompts 
(in development)

🤖 *AI Agent Framework* - Custom AI assistants for specific business needs 
(prototyping)  

🦆 *rubberDucky Platform* - Working demo built with Next.js 15, featuring voice 
integration and real-time AI streaming

🎯 *Business Integration Tools* - Solutions for implementing AI effectively in 
existing workflows (planning)

** Our Approach:
Drawing from rubber duck debugging principles, we're creating systematic 
approaches to AI context design. Our focus is on making AI interactions more 
consistent and reliable for practical business applications.

** Current Technical Work:
- Multi-turn conversation design patterns
- Voice-enabled AI prototypes with real-time responses
- Context optimization and cost efficiency research
- Production testing with MongoDB + Next.js stack
- Security and authentication development

** Target Applications:
Software development teams, business consultants, educational organizations, 
and creative professionals looking to improve their AI implementations through 
better context engineering.

** Current Status:
We're actively developing and testing our platform components. Interested in 
contributing feedback or exploring early access? We're connecting with 
organizations interested in practical AI improvements.
