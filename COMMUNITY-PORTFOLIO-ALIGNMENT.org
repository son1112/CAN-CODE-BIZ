** Documentation Standards for Community Projects
*** For Each Community Project:
- Clear description of what we're learning
- How we're learning it (methodology anyone can replicate)
- What we've found so far (successes and challenges)
- Honest discussion of what works and what doesn't
- Instructions so others can learn with us
- Open-source contribution guidelines
