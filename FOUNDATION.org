*** Recognition of Mission

**Core Realization**:
People aren't bad at communicating—they're communicating in ways that
aren't always recognized. Technology should bridge gaps through translation,
not enforce conformity through correction. And to teach is to learn—we grow
most when we share what we've learned with others.

**Personal Foundation**:
- Neurodivergent lived experience with communication challenges
- Direct understanding of accessibility barriers
- Recognition that existing tools prioritize "normal" over functional
- Deep empathy for those technology typically overlooks

**Community Opportunity**:
- Underserved communities in AI development
- Accessibility often afterthought, not foundation
- Marketing hype obscures honest capability sharing
- Need for transparent collaborative learning
- Opportunity to teach and learn together

*** From Business to Community Learning

**Philosophy Shift**:
| Aspect | BEER Era | can.code Research (2024-2025) | can.code Community (2026+) |
|--------+----------+-------------------------------+----------------------------|
| Focus | General consulting | Focused research | Community learning |
| Measure | Revenue | User thriving | Collective growth |
| Priority | Client satisfaction | Research integrity | Community impact |
| Approach | Solutions | Understanding | Teaching & Learning |
| Output | Products | Knowledge | Open-source tools |

**Organizational Evolution**:
- From consulting firm → research labs (2024-2025) → community learning (2026+)
- From profit center → research mission → social impact through sharing
- From client work → research projects → community collaboration
- From business solutions → assistive technology → open-source contributions

   - Technology serves human flourishing
   - Systemic change in how we value communication diversity
   - Assistive technology for neurodivergent communities

*** Transparent Limitation Documentation

**Methodology**:
- Document what doesn't work as rigorously as what does
- Honest capability assessment over marketing claims
- Failure modes analyzed and published
- Success rates with reproducible methodology

**Contrast with Industry**:
| Aspect | Industry Standard | can.code Approach |
|--------+-------------------+-------------------|
| Marketing | Overpromise | Underpromise |
| Limitations | Buried/minimized | 1,200-word dedicated sections |
| Failures | Omitted | Documented rigorously |
| Metrics | Best case | Honest averages |

**Example**: Voice-AI research paper
- 73% success rate (not "revolutionary")
- 1,200 words on limitations
- "When NOT to use" guidance explicit
- Unexpected negative findings included

*** Recognition Over Correction
