**Building Better AI Context Engineering Tools**

can.code is developing a context engineering platform to help businesses create more effective AI interactions. We're in pre-alpha, focusing on practical tools and methodologies for prompt optimization and AI conversation design.

## What We're Building:
- **Context Engineering Sandbox** - Tools for testing and refining AI prompts (in development)
- **AI Agent Framework** - Custom AI assistants for specific business needs (prototyping)  
- **rubberDucky Platform** - Working demo built with Next.js 15, featuring voice integration and real-time AI streaming
- **Business Integration Tools** - Solutions for implementing AI effectively in existing workflows (planning)

## Our Approach:
Drawing from rubber duck debugging principles, we're creating systematic approaches to AI context design. Our focus is on making AI interactions more consistent and reliable for practical business applications.

## Current Technical Work:
- Multi-turn conversation design patterns
- Voice-enabled AI prototypes with real-time responses
- Context optimization and cost efficiency research
- Production testing with MongoDB + Next.js stack
- Security and authentication development

## Target Applications:
Software development teams, business consultants, educational organizations, and creative professionals looking to improve their AI implementations through better context engineering.

## Current Status:
We're actively developing and testing our platform components. Interested in contributing feedback or exploring early access? We're connecting with organizations interested in practical AI improvements.
