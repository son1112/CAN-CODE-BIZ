* Technical Architecture Deep Dive

** Database Design
*** Core Models
**** CanApplication Model
The primary business model capturing customer requests:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
# Customer Information
company_name, contact_person, email, phone contacts
mailing_address, city, state, zip

# Test Configuration  
semen_test_count, saliva_test_count, colostrum_test_count
total_amount_due, rush_order (boolean)

# Processing Workflow States
approved (boolean), paid (boolean), signed (boolean)
order_id, signature

# Flexible Data Storage
billing_info (JSONB) - separate billing addresses
admin (JSONB) - administrative metadata  
breed_assoc_auth (JSONB) - regulatory authorization data
#+END_SRC

**** Content Management System
Dynamic content delivery for workflow steps:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
# Content Structure
title, subtitle, body, header, footer
content_type # "info", "application", "sign", "pay", "data"
categories, tags
html # rendered content for display
#+END_SRC

** Application Flow Architecture
*** Multi-Step Workflow Implementation
1. **Information Capture** (`content_type: "application"`)
   - Customer details and contact information
   - Test quantity specification
   - Rush order selection
   
2. **Digital Signature** (`content_type: "sign"`) 
   - Legal authorization workflow preparation
   - Regulatory compliance setup

3. **Payment Processing** (`content_type: "pay"`)
   - Stripe embedded checkout integration
   - Quantity-based pricing calculation
   - Rush order premium handling

4. **Confirmation & Data** (`content_type: "data"`)
   - Order summary and receipt
   - Sample collection instructions

** Payment System Architecture
*** Stripe Integration Pattern
- **Pricing Model**: Per-test pricing with rush order premiums
- **Standard Rate**: Configurable via `test_price_id`
