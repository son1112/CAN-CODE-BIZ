3. Claude API streams tokens in real-time
4. Tokens forwarded to client via SSE
5. UI updates progressively as tokens arrive

### Intelligent Conversation Management
The `useConversationManager` hook determines when AI should respond based on:
- Question detection (phrases with ?, what, how, why, etc.)
- Conversation context (responding to AI messages)
- Greetings and conversation starters
- Substantial statements requiring responses
- Direct mentions of AI agent
- Smart filtering to avoid responding to simple acknowledgments

### Agent System
Multiple AI personalities with:
- Custom system prompts
- Conversation starters
- Key topic specializations
- Context management for personalized responses
