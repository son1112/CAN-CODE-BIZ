- Server-side rendering with SSR compatibility
- Component-based architecture
- Proper 'use client' directive usage

*** 🔧 NEEDS IMPROVEMENT - Action Required
- Hydration error handling and prevention
- State management consolidation and optimization
- Loading state management patterns
- Streaming and selective hydration
- Bundle optimization and caching strategies

*** ❌ CRITICAL - Major Refactoring Needed
- Multiple context providers creating hydration complexity
- Inconsistent loading state patterns across components
- Manual memoization instead of React Compiler utilization
- Missing progressive hydration for large message lists

* Detailed Improvement Plan

** Phase 1: Hydration Stabilization (Week 1-2)
*** Priority: 🔴 CRITICAL

**** 1.1 Hydration Mismatch Prevention
**Problem**: Recent session message visibility bug caused by hydration mismatches
**Solution**: Implement 2025 hydration best practices

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Move all dynamic logic (Date, Math.random, localStorage) to useEffect
- [ ] Implement consistent server/client rendering patterns
- [ ] Add suppressHydrationWarning only where absolutely necessary
- [ ] Create reusable hydration-safe components for common patterns

**Files Affected:**
- `contexts/SessionContext.tsx` - Already partially fixed
- `app/components/ChatInterface.tsx` - Apply hydration patterns
- `app/components/MessageItem.tsx` - Ensure consistent rendering

**Expected Outcome:** Zero hydration warnings, stable message visibility

**** 1.2 Client-Side State Initialization
**Problem**: State initialized differently on server vs client
**Solution**: Implement client-ready pattern consistently

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Standardize client-ready checks across all contexts
- [ ] Implement loading skeletons for hydration delays
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries for hydration failures

**** 1.3 Enhanced Error Handling
**Problem**: Hydration errors are hard to debug
**Solution**: Leverage Next.js 15 improved hydration error view

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Add detailed error logging for hydration mismatches
- [ ] Implement error recovery patterns
- [ ] Create development-mode hydration debugging tools

** Phase 2: State Management Optimization (Week 3-4)
*** Priority: 🟡 HIGH

**** 2.1 Context Consolidation
**Problem**: Multiple contexts (Session, Agent, Theme, Onboarding) creating complexity
**Solution**: Follow "useState first" principle from 2025 best practices

**Current Context Analysis:**
```typescript
// Too many contexts:
- SessionContext (large, complex)
- AgentContext (performance optimized)  
- ThemeContext (simple)
- OnboardingContext (simple)
- ModelContext (medium complexity)
```

**Implementation Strategy:**
- [ ] **Keep SessionContext**: Too complex to consolidate, already optimized
- [ ] **Keep AgentContext**: Performance-critical, well-optimized
- [ ] **Merge Simple Contexts**: Combine Theme + Onboarding + Model into AppPreferencesContext
- [ ] **Reduce Context Providers**: Use compound provider pattern

**Expected Outcome:** 3 contexts instead of 5, reduced hydration complexity

**** 2.2 Built-in State Management First
**Problem**: Over-reliance on contexts for simple state
**Solution**: Use useState, useReducer for component-local state

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Audit all contexts for state that could be component-local
- [ ] Move UI state (dropdowns, modals) to component useState
- [ ] Keep only shared business logic in contexts

**** 2.3 State Management Library Evaluation
**Problem**: Bundle size impact from multiple context providers
**Solution**: Evaluate lightweight alternatives for non-critical state

**Options Analysis:**
- **Jotai**: For complex shared state (if needed)
- **TanStack Query**: For server state caching
- **Zustand**: Minimal bundle size alternative

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Profile current bundle size impact
- [ ] Identify candidates for external state management
- [ ] Implement if bundle savings > 10KB

** Phase 3: Loading State Modernization (Week 5-6)
*** Priority: 🟡 HIGH

**** 3.1 Streaming and Suspense Implementation
**Problem**: All-or-nothing loading patterns
**Solution**: Implement Next.js 15 streaming with React Suspense

**Current Loading Patterns:**
```typescript
// Current: Blocks entire interface
if (isLoadingSession) return <LoadingSpinner />

// Target: Stream components as they load
<Suspense fallback={<MessageListSkeleton />}>
  <MessageList />
</Suspense>
```

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Implement Suspense boundaries around heavy components
- [ ] Add loading skeletons for each component type
- [ ] Enable streaming for session loading
- [ ] Implement progressive message loading

**** 3.2 Selective Hydration
**Problem**: All components hydrate at once
**Solution**: Prioritize above-the-fold content

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Wrap non-critical components in Suspense
- [ ] Defer hydration of message virtualization
- [ ] Prioritize chat input and session header hydration
- [ ] Lazy load export functionality

**** 3.3 Loading State Consistency
**Problem**: Inconsistent loading patterns across components
**Solution**: Create standardized loading components

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Create reusable skeleton components
- [ ] Implement loading state hook (useLoadingState)
- [ ] Standardize error state handling
- [ ] Add loading indicators for all async operations

** Phase 4: Performance Optimization (Week 7-8)
*** Priority: 🟡 MEDIUM

**** 4.1 React Compiler Integration
**Problem**: Manual memoization with useMemo/useCallback
**Solution**: Enable React Compiler in Next.js 15

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Enable React Compiler in next.config.js
- [ ] Remove manual memoization where compiler handles it
- [ ] Profile performance improvements
- [ ] Update component patterns for compiler optimization

**** 4.2 Bundle Optimization
**Problem**: Suboptimal external package bundling
**Solution**: Use Next.js 15 stable bundling configuration

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Configure external package optimization
- [ ] Implement dynamic imports for heavy components
- [ ] Analyze and optimize bundle splitting
- [ ] Add bundle analyzer to development workflow

**** 4.3 Caching Strategy Update
**Problem**: Using outdated caching patterns
**Solution**: Implement Next.js 15 fresh-by-default caching

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Review current fetch caching strategies
- [ ] Implement selective caching where appropriate
- [ ] Add cache invalidation patterns
- [ ] Optimize database query caching

**** 4.4 Database Query Optimization
**Problem**: Session list loading performance (user reported)
**Solution**: Implement efficient querying patterns

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Use MongoDB projections for list views
- [ ] Add proper database indexes
- [ ] Implement pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Cache session metadata on client

** Phase 5: Advanced Features (Week 9-10)
*** Priority: 🟢 LOW

**** 5.1 Progressive Web App Enhancement
**Problem**: Missing PWA optimization
**Solution**: Enhance PWA capabilities with streaming

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Implement service worker with streaming support
- [ ] Add offline message queuing
- [ ] Cache critical resources with streaming awareness
- [ ] Implement background sync for messages

**** 5.2 Advanced Streaming Patterns
**Problem**: Basic streaming implementation
**Solution**: Implement advanced streaming with prioritization

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Implement message streaming with priority
- [ ] Add intelligent prefetching
- [ ] Implement streaming search results
- [ ] Add real-time streaming for collaborative features

**** 5.3 Accessibility and SEO
**Problem**: Missing accessibility optimization
