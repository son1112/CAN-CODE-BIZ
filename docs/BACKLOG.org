* Notes
- This backlog is continuously updated based on user feedback and development priorities
- Estimates are rough and may change based on implementation complexity
- Items may be moved between priority levels based on business needs
- Regular backlog grooming sessions should be conducted to keep this current

** Documentation Standards
The "Current Session Backlog Items - Detailed Documentation" section demonstrates comprehensive backlog item documentation that includes:
- Clear problem statements with business context
- Technical requirements and constraints
- Implementation approaches with step-by-step plans
- Priority levels (ðŸ”´ HIGH, ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM, ðŸŸ¢ LOW) and complexity estimates
- Dependencies and prerequisite work
- Acceptance criteria with measurable outcomes
- Related files and components affected

This documentation format should be used as a template for future backlog items to ensure consistency and actionability.
