** 🔴 HIGH Priority

*** Chat Message Rendering Bug - Messages Hidden/Not Displayed  
**** Problem Statement
**CRITICAL**: Chat messages completely disappear or fail to render in sessions with many messages, leaving blank/empty chat interface despite messages existing.

**** Specific Issues Identified
- **Session with 38+ messages**: "Rivo AI Rails Eng" session shows message count and metadata but zero visible messages
- **Blank Chat Area**: Main message display area is completely empty despite active session
- **Mobile Impact**: Issue discovered on mobile, may affect mobile users disproportionately
- **Long Session Duration**: Issue appears in sessions with significant duration (144h 48m in example)

**** Technical Details
- Message virtualization system may be failing
- VirtualizedMessageList component potentially not rendering messages
- Could be related to scroll position, viewport calculations, or message loading logic
- Session metadata loads correctly (count: 38, duration: 144h 48m) but content doesn't display
- Affects user's ability to see conversation history entirely

**** Suspected Root Causes
1. **Message Virtualization Issue**: VirtualizedMessageList not calculating or rendering message items
2. **Scroll Position Bug**: Messages rendered outside visible viewport
3. **State Management**: Message loading/display state not updating properly
4. **Mobile Viewport**: Responsive design issues affecting message container dimensions

**** Implementation Approach
**IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION REQUIRED:**
1. **Debug VirtualizedMessageList Component**
   - Check message array population and rendering logic
   - Verify scroll position and viewport calculations
   - Test with sessions of varying message counts

2. **Message Loading Pipeline**
   - Verify API responses contain message data
   - Check state management between hooks and components
   - Ensure useStreamingChat properly loads historical messages

3. **Mobile/Responsive Testing** 
   - Test across different device sizes and orientations
   - Verify CSS container dimensions and overflow handling
   - Check touch scrolling and viewport interactions

**** Priority Level: 🔴 HIGH (CRITICAL - Complete message display failure)
**** Complexity Estimate: Medium (1-2 weeks) - Requires deep debugging of virtualization system
**** Dependencies: VirtualizedMessageList, useStreamingChat, message loading system
**** Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All messages display correctly in sessions regardless of message count
- [ ] Message virtualization works properly on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Scroll behavior maintains message visibility
- [ ] Long-running sessions display complete message history
- [ ] No blank/empty chat interfaces in active sessions

- hooks/useStreamingChat.ts (message loading/state management)
- hooks/useMessageVirtualization.ts (virtualization logic)

*** Session Header State Persistence Bug
**** Problem Statement
**CRITICAL**: When starting a new conversation, session header retains name and details from previously rendered session chat instead of showing current/new session information.

**** Technical Details
- Session header shows stale data from previous session
- Affects new conversation creation user experience
- May indicate state management issues in session context or header component
- Could confuse users about which session they're actually in

**** Implementation Approach
**IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION REQUIRED:**
1. **Debug Session Header Component**
   - Check state management and prop updates
   - Verify session context is properly updated on route/session changes
   - Ensure header re-renders when new session is created

2. **Session Context Management**
   - Review session switching logic
   - Check for stale state persistence between session changes
   - Verify cleanup when creating new sessions

**** Priority Level: 🔴 HIGH (CRITICAL - State management failure)
**** Complexity Estimate: Simple to Medium (3-5 days)
**** Dependencies: Session context, Header component, Session routing
**** Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New conversation shows correct session header immediately
- [ ] No stale data from previous sessions persists
- [ ] Session header updates properly on all session changes
**** Related Files
- app/components/SessionHeader.tsx (or similar header component)
- contexts/SessionContext.tsx (session state management)
- Session routing and navigation logic

*** UI Low Contrast Text/Background Issues
**** Problem Statement
Critical accessibility and readability issues due to severely low contrast between text and background colors, making content nearly unreadable.

**** Specific Issues Identified
- **Dark Mode "Let's chat about:" Dialogue**: Light gray text on gray background in welcome dialogue bubble
- **Message Content**: "Quack quack! Ready for some classic rubber duck debugging?" text is barely visible in dark mode
- **System Messages**: Welcome/intro messages have insufficient contrast ratios specifically in dark theme

Need ability to click on text sections to make them more prominent/highlighted/featured in messages.

**** Implementation Approach
Add interactive text highlighting functionality for better message readability and emphasis.

** 🟢 LOW Priority

*** PWA Icons Missing (404 Errors)
**** Problem Statement
Manifest.json references icons in `/icons/` directory that don't exist, causing 404 errors for PWA functionality.

**** Implementation Approach
Create missing PWA icons from existing rubber duck logos in various required sizes (72x72 to 512x512).
