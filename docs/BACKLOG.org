** ðŸ”´ HIGH Priority

*** Session Chat Message Order - Change Message Display Order
**** Problem Statement
**UX FEATURE**: Users need the ability to change the order in which messages are displayed within a chat session for better conversation flow and usability.

**** Specific Issues Identified
- **Fixed Message Order**: Messages currently display in a fixed chronological order
- **User Preference**: Different users may prefer different message ordering (newest first vs oldest first)
- **Conversation Flow**: Some debugging/analysis workflows benefit from reverse chronological order
- **Usability**: No option to customize message display to user preference

**** Technical Details
- Messages are currently rendered in chronological order (oldest to newest)
- No UI controls to toggle message order
- Message virtualization may need updates to handle order changes
- Scroll position management needed when order changes

**** Suspected Root Causes
1. **Hard-coded Message Order**: Message rendering assumes chronological order
2. **Missing UI Controls**: No toggle/button to change message order
3. **State Management**: No preference storage for message order setting
4. **Virtualization**: VirtualizedMessageList may need order-aware updates

**** Implementation Approach
**FEATURE DEVELOPMENT REQUIRED:**
1. **UI Controls Implementation**
   - Add message order toggle button to chat interface
   - Design intuitive toggle (newest first â†” oldest first)
   - Position in session header or chat controls area

2. **State Management**
   - Add messageOrder preference to user settings
   - Store preference in localStorage and user preferences API
   - Update ChatInterface to respect order preference

3. **Message Rendering Updates**
   - Update filteredMessages logic to respect order preference
   - Modify VirtualizedMessageList for reverse order support
   - Maintain scroll position during order changes

4. **Preference Persistence**
   - Store message order preference per user
   - Apply preference across all sessions
   - Sync with user preferences API

**** Priority: ðŸ”´ HIGH
**** Complexity: Medium
**** Estimated Time: 3-4 hours
**** Dependencies: None
**** Related Files:
- `app/components/ChatInterface.tsx` - Main message display logic
- `app/components/VirtualizedMessageList.tsx` - Message virtualization
- `contexts/PreferencesContext.tsx` - User preference management
- `app/api/preferences/route.ts` - Preference storage API

**** Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Toggle button to switch between newest first / oldest first
- [ ] Message order preference persists across sessions
- [ ] Smooth transition when changing order (no jarring jumps)
- [ ] Scroll position maintained appropriately during order changes
- [ ] Works with message virtualization system
- [ ] Preference stored in user settings

*** Session History Loading Performance - Slow Session List
**** Problem Statement
**PERFORMANCE**: Session history list is slow to load session items, causing poor user experience when navigating between conversations.

**** Specific Issues Identified
- **Slow Session Loading**: Session list takes too long to populate
- **User Experience**: Delay impacts navigation between conversations
- **Performance Impact**: May affect user retention and workflow efficiency

**** Technical Details
- loadSessions API call may be inefficient
- Large session data may be loaded unnecessarily
- Database queries might not be optimized
- React rendering performance could be improved

**** Suspected Root Causes
1. **Database Query Optimization**: Inefficient MongoDB queries loading full session data
2. **API Response Size**: Loading full message content when only metadata needed
3. **React Rendering**: Inefficient list rendering without virtualization
4. **Caching**: No proper caching strategy for session metadata

**** Implementation Approach
**OPTIMIZATION REQUIRED:**
1. **Database Query Optimization**
   - Use projection to load only metadata (name, date, message count)
   - Add proper indexes on userId, createdAt, updatedAt fields
   - Implement pagination for large session lists

2. **API Response Optimization**
   - Create lightweight session metadata API endpoint
   - Separate full session loading from list loading
   - Add caching headers for session lists

3. **Frontend Performance**
   - Implement virtual scrolling for session list
   - Add proper loading states and skeleton screens
   - Cache session metadata in React state/local storage

**** Priority: ðŸ”´ HIGH
**** Complexity: Medium
**** Estimated Time: 4-6 hours
**** Dependencies: None
**** Related Files:
- `/api/sessions/route.ts` - Session list API
- `/contexts/SessionContext.tsx` - Session state management
- `/components/SessionList.tsx` - Session list UI component

**** Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Session list loads in <500ms
- [ ] Smooth scrolling with large session lists
- [ ] Proper loading states during fetch
- [ ] Cache session metadata locally
- [ ] Maintain current functionality
   - Ensure useStreamingChat properly loads historical messages

3. **Mobile/Responsive Testing** 
   - Test across different device sizes and orientations
   - Verify CSS container dimensions and overflow handling
   - Check touch scrolling and viewport interactions

**** Priority Level: ðŸ”´ HIGH (CRITICAL - Complete message display failure)
**** Complexity Estimate: Medium (1-2 weeks) - Requires deep debugging of virtualization system
**** Dependencies: VirtualizedMessageList, useStreamingChat, message loading system
**** Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All messages display correctly in sessions regardless of message count
- [ ] Message virtualization works properly on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Scroll behavior maintains message visibility
- [ ] Long-running sessions display complete message history
- [ ] No blank/empty chat interfaces in active sessions

- app/components/ChatInterface.tsx (main chat container)
- hooks/useStreamingChat.ts (message loading/state management)
- hooks/useMessageVirtualization.ts (virtualization logic)

*** Session Header State Persistence Bug
**** Problem Statement
**CRITICAL**: When starting a new conversation, session header retains name and details from previously rendered session chat instead of showing current/new session information.

**** Technical Details
- Session header shows stale data from previous session
- Affects new conversation creation user experience
- May indicate state management issues in session context or header component
- Could confuse users about which session they're actually in

**** Implementation Approach
**IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION REQUIRED:**
1. **Debug Session Header Component**
   - Check state management and prop updates
   - Verify session context is properly updated on route/session changes
   - Ensure header re-renders when new session is created

2. **Session Context Management**
   - Review session switching logic
   - Check for stale state persistence between session changes
   - Verify cleanup when creating new sessions

**** Priority Level: ðŸ”´ HIGH (CRITICAL - State management failure)
**** Complexity Estimate: Simple to Medium (3-5 days)
**** Dependencies: Session context, Header component, Session routing
**** Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New conversation shows correct session header immediately
- [ ] No stale data from previous sessions persists
- [ ] Session header updates properly on all session changes
**** Related Files
- app/components/SessionHeader.tsx (or similar header component)
- contexts/SessionContext.tsx (session state management)
