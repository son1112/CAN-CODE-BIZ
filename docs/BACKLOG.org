*** Record Button Response Lag - Voice Input UI Performance Issue
**** Problem Statement
**PERFORMANCE ISSUE**: The voice recording button experiences noticeable response lag when clicked, impacting user experience during voice input interactions.

**** Specific Issues Identified
- **Button Response Delay**: Noticeable lag between clicking record button and visual feedback

- **UI Responsiveness**: Button feels sluggish compared to other interface elements

**** Technical Details
- VoiceInput component may have performance bottlenecks in click handler
- Possible state update delays causing UI lag
- WebSocket connection initialization might block button response
- AssemblyAI token fetch could be causing delay

**** Suspected Root Causes
1. **Heavy Click Handler**: Button click handler may be performing synchronous operations
2. **State Update Blocking**: setState operations might be blocking UI updates
3. **API Call Blocking**: AssemblyAI token generation blocking button response
4. **Component Re-rendering**: Expensive re-renders triggered by button state changes

**** Implementation Approach
**PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION REQUIRED:**

*** Session Chat Message Order - Change Message Display Order
**** Problem Statement
**UX FEATURE**: Users need the ability to change the order in which messages are displayed within a chat session for better conversation flow and usability.

**** Specific Issues Identified
- **Fixed Message Order**: Messages currently display in a fixed chronological order
- **User Preference**: Different users may prefer different message ordering (newest first vs oldest first)
- **Conversation Flow**: Some debugging/analysis workflows benefit from reverse chronological order
- **Usability**: No option to customize message display to user preference

**** Technical Details
- Messages are currently rendered in chronological order (oldest to newest)
- No UI controls to toggle message order
- Message virtualization may need updates to handle order changes
- Scroll position management needed when order changes

**** Suspected Root Causes
1. **Hard-coded Message Order**: Message rendering assumes chronological order
2. **Missing UI Controls**: No toggle/button to change message order
3. **State Management**: No preference storage for message order setting
4. **Virtualization**: VirtualizedMessageList may need order-aware updates

**** Implementation Approach
**FEATURE DEVELOPMENT REQUIRED:**
1. **UI Controls Implementation**
   - Add message order toggle button to chat interface
   - Design intuitive toggle (newest first â†” oldest first)
   - Position in session header or chat controls area

2. **State Management**

- Database queries might not be optimized
- React rendering performance could be improved

**** Suspected Root Causes
1. **Database Query Optimization**: Inefficient MongoDB queries loading full session data
2. **API Response Size**: Loading full message content when only metadata needed
3. **React Rendering**: Inefficient list rendering without virtualization
4. **Caching**: No proper caching strategy for session metadata

**** Implementation Approach
**OPTIMIZATION REQUIRED:**
1. **Database Query Optimization**
