#+AUTHOR: Project Tracker Development Team
#+DATE: 2025-09-09
#+STARTUP: overview
#+FILETAGS: claude-code agents backlog integration guide documentation

* Overview

This guide provides Claude Code agents working in other applications with comprehensive 
instructions for creating and adapting backlog files that integrate seamlessly with 
the Project Tracker application's AI-powered directory analysis system.

** Target Audience
- Claude Code agents working on software projects
- Development teams using Project Tracker for project management
- AI assistants managing project backlogs and task tracking
- Developers integrating Project Tracker into existing workflows

** Integration Benefits
- Automatic task detection and counting in Project Tracker UI
- AI-powered project analysis with backlog insights
- Cross-project task visibility and progress tracking
- Standardized task management across development projects

* Supported File Formats and Detection

** File Naming Conventions
Project Tracker automatically discovers backlog files with these names:
- =BACKLOG.org= (recommended primary format)
- =TODO.org=
- =BACKLOG.md=
- =TODO.md=
- =TODO.txt=
- =BACKLOG.txt=
- =tasks.org=, =tasks.md=, =tasks.txt=

** File Format Priority
1. **Org-mode (.org)** - Primary format with full feature support
2. **Markdown (.md)** - Good compatibility with checkbox syntax
3. **Plain text (.txt)** - Basic support for simple checkbox patterns

* Org-Mode Format (Recommended)

** Basic Task Structure
#+BEGIN_SRC org
* Project Tasks
** TODO Implement user authentication
   DEADLINE: <2025-09-15>
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT: 4h
   :PRIORITY: A
   :END:
   
** IN-PROGRESS Design database schema
   SCHEDULED: <2025-09-10>
   
** DONE Setup development environment
   CLOSED: [2025-09-08]
#+END_SRC

** Supported Task Statuses

*** Active Tasks (counted in todoCount)
- =TODO= - Standard pending task
- =IN-PROGRESS= - Currently being worked on

*** Completed Tasks (counted in completedCount)  
- =DONE= - Successfully completed task

*** Other Statuses (tracked but not counted)
- =CANCELLED= - Task cancelled or no longer needed

** Task Hierarchy
Any heading level is supported (*, **, ***, etc.):
#+BEGIN_SRC org

* Best Practices for Claude Code Agents

** File Naming Strategy
1. **Primary backlog**: Always use =BACKLOG.org= as the main project backlog
2. **Specialized lists**: Use descriptive names like =BUGS.org=, =FEATURES.org=
3. **Sprint planning**: Consider =SPRINT-N.org= for specific sprint backlogs

** Task Organization Hierarchy
#+BEGIN_SRC org
* Project Overview
Brief description of project goals and status

* High Priority Features (Sprint 1)
** TODO Critical Feature A
   DEADLINE: <2025-09-15>
   :PROPERTIES:
   :PRIORITY: A+
   :END:

** TODO Important Feature B  
   DEADLINE: <2025-09-20>
   :PROPERTIES:
   :PRIORITY: A
   :END:

* Medium Priority Features (Sprint 2)
** TODO Nice-to-have Feature C
   :PROPERTIES:
   :PRIORITY: B
   :END:

* Technical Debt and Maintenance
** TODO Code refactoring
** TODO Update dependencies
** TODO Performance optimization

* Completed Features
** DONE Foundation setup
   CLOSED: [2025-09-01]
** DONE Initial implementation  
   CLOSED: [2025-09-05]
#+END_SRC

** Task Description Guidelines
1. **Clear titles**: Use descriptive, actionable task titles
2. **Detailed descriptions**: Include implementation notes in task body
3. **Dependencies**: Note task dependencies and blockers
4. **Acceptance criteria**: Define what constitutes task completion

** Effort and Time Tracking
#+BEGIN_SRC org
** TODO Implement user dashboard
   DEADLINE: <2025-09-25>
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EFFORT: 12h
   :PRIORITY: A
   :CATEGORY: Frontend
   :END:
   
   Create user dashboard with:
   - User profile display
   - Activity timeline
   - Settings panel
   
   Estimated breakdown:
   - UI design: 3h
   - Component implementation: 6h  
   - Testing: 2h
   - Documentation: 1h
#+END_SRC

** Status Transition Guidelines
#+BEGIN_SRC org
** TODO → IN-PROGRESS Task name
   When starting work on a task

** IN-PROGRESS → DONE Task name  
   CLOSED: [2025-09-09]
   When completing a task

** TODO → CANCELLED Task name
   When task is no longer needed
#+END_SRC

* Integration with Project Tracker Analysis

** AI Analysis Enhancement
When Project Tracker analyzes your directory, backlog files enhance the analysis:
- **Task count visibility**: Shows active vs completed work
- **Project health indicators**: Completion percentages and velocity
- **Progress tracking**: Historical task completion patterns
- **Project insights**: AI recommendations based on backlog patterns

** Directory Structure Recommendations
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
project-root/
├── BACKLOG.org              # Main project backlog
├── src/                     # Source code
├── docs/                    # Documentation
│   ├── FEATURES.org         # Detailed feature specifications
│   └── BUGS.org             # Known issues and fixes
├── tests/                   # Test files
└── scripts/
    └── DEPLOYMENT.org       # Deployment tasks and checklists
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Multi-File Backlog Strategy
For large projects, organize backlogs by area:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
* Main BACKLOG.org - Project overview and high-level tasks
* FEATURES.org - Detailed feature development tasks
* BUGS.org - Bug fixes and issue resolution
* MAINTENANCE.org - Technical debt and maintenance tasks
* DEPLOYMENT.org - Release and deployment checklists

** Updating Task Status
#+BEGIN_SRC org
# When updating task progress
** IN-PROGRESS Implement user authentication
   Started: [2025-09-09]
   
   Progress notes:
   - Set up authentication middleware ✓
   - Implemented JWT token generation ✓

* Integration Testing and Validation

** Validation Checklist
Before committing backlog files, verify:
- [ ] File uses supported naming convention
- [ ] Tasks use proper status keywords (TODO, IN-PROGRESS, DONE)
- [ ] File is placed in project root or discoverable location
- [ ] Syntax follows format-specific conventions
- [ ] Task titles are descriptive and actionable

** Testing with Project Tracker
1. **Add directory**: Add your project directory to Project Tracker
2. **Verify detection**: Confirm backlog files are discovered
3. **Check counts**: Verify task counts match expectations
4. **Review analysis**: Examine AI analysis results for backlog insights

** Common Issues and Solutions

*** Tasks Not Detected
- Verify file naming matches supported conventions
- Check task status keywords are exact (case-sensitive)
- Ensure proper syntax for chosen format

*** Incorrect Counts
- Review status keywords for typos
- Check for unsupported status variations
- Verify format-specific syntax requirements

*** File Not Found  
- Place backlog files in project root directory
- Use standard naming conventions
- Check file permissions and accessibility

* Advanced Integration Patterns

** Cross-Project Dependencies
#+BEGIN_SRC org
** TODO Implement shared authentication service
   :PROPERTIES:
   :PRIORITY: A
   :DEPENDENCIES: user-management-service
   :BLOCKS: mobile-app, web-dashboard
   :END:
   
   This task depends on completion of user-management-service
   and blocks mobile-app and web-dashboard development.

#+END_SRC

* Troubleshooting Guide

** Common File Format Issues
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Tasks not counting | Check status keywords: TODO, IN-PROGRESS, DONE |
| File not detected | Use supported filename: BACKLOG.org, TODO.md |
| Org syntax errors | Verify heading levels with * ** *** |
| Markdown not parsing | Ensure checkbox format: - [ ] and - [x] |

** Performance Considerations
- Keep individual backlog files under 1000 lines
- Use multiple files for large projects (BACKLOG.org, FEATURES.org, etc.)
- Place files in project root for fastest detection
- Avoid deeply nested directory structures for backlog files

** Directory Structure Optimization
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
✓ Good: project-root/BACKLOG.org
✓ Good: project-root/docs/FEATURES.org  
✗ Avoid: project-root/src/lib/internal/tasks.org
✗ Avoid: very-deeply-nested/path/TODO.md
#+END_EXAMPLE

1. **Always create BACKLOG.org** as the primary project backlog
2. **Use consistent status keywords**: TODO, IN-PROGRESS, DONE
3. **Include effort estimates** and deadlines when possible
4. **Organize hierarchically** with clear project structure
5. **Update task status** as work progresses
6. **Add descriptive context** in task bodies
7. **Test integration** by adding directory to Project Tracker
