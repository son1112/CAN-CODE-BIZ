# User Onboarding & Free Trial Experience - Implementation Plan

## üéØ Executive Summary

Transform Rubber Ducky Live's current basic onboarding into a strategic, conversion-optimized free trial experience that showcases premium features and drives subscription conversions. This plan builds on the existing OnboardingContext foundation while adding trial management, progressive feature introduction, and conversion optimization.

## üìä Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure ‚úÖ
- **OnboardingContext**: Well-structured with 8 comprehensive steps
- **User Authentication**: Google OAuth with NextAuth.js
- **User Preferences**: Sophisticated user settings system
- **Feature Infrastructure**: Claude 4/3.5, voice recognition, export system
- **Demo Mode**: Functional for development testing

### Key Gaps to Address ‚ùå
- No trial management system or expiration handling
- Missing conversion optimization and upgrade prompts
- No progressive feature introduction based on usage
- Lack of trial-specific analytics and tracking
- No email engagement system for trial users
- Missing subscription tier management

## üöÄ Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Trial Management Foundation (Week 1)
**Objective**: Create robust trial system infrastructure

#### 1.1 User Tier System Enhancement
```typescript
// New: Enhanced User model with trial management
interface UserTier {
  tier: 'trial' | 'free' | 'pro' | 'enterprise'
  trialStartDate?: Date
  trialEndDate?: Date
  trialExtensions: number
  featuresUsed: string[]
  conversionCheckpoints: ConversionCheckpoint[]
}

interface ConversionCheckpoint {
  feature: string
  timestamp: Date
  engagement: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
  convertedToUpgrade: boolean
}
```

#### 1.2 Trial Management Context
```typescript
// New: contexts/TrialContext.tsx
interface TrialContextType {
  isTrialActive: boolean
  trialDaysRemaining: number
  trialExpiresAt: Date | null
  hasTrialExpired: boolean
  extendTrial: (days: number) => Promise<void>
  trackFeatureUsage: (feature: string) => void
  getTrialProgress: () => TrialProgress
}
```

#### 1.3 Core Files to Create/Modify
- `models/UserTier.ts` - Trial management data model
- `contexts/TrialContext.tsx` - Trial state management
- `hooks/useTrialStatus.ts` - Trial status and actions
- `lib/trial/trialManager.ts` - Trial lifecycle logic

    voicePremium: true,      // Premium voice features
    prioritySupport: true,   // Trial support
    duration: '7_days'       // Time limitation
  },
  free: {
    claude4: false,          // Restricted after trial
    exports: '5_per_month',  // Limited exports
    voicePremium: false,     // Basic voice only
    prioritySupport: false,  // Community support
    duration: 'permanent'    // No time limit
  },
  pro: {
    claude4: true,           // Full access
    exports: 'unlimited',    // No limits
    voicePremium: true,      // All premium features

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- User tier management
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN tier VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'trial';
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN trial_start_date TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN trial_end_date TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN trial_extensions INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

-- Conversion tracking
CREATE TABLE conversion_events (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES users(id),
  event_type VARCHAR(100),
  feature VARCHAR(100),
  engagement_level VARCHAR(20),
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Trial analytics
CREATE TABLE trial_analytics (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES users(id),
  trial_day INTEGER,
  features_used JSON,
  session_duration INTEGER,
  conversion_checkpoints JSON,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### API Endpoints
```typescript
// Trial management
POST /api/trial/start     - Initialize user trial
GET  /api/trial/status    - Check trial status
POST /api/trial/extend    - Extend trial period
POST /api/trial/convert   - Convert to paid subscription

// Analytics
POST /api/analytics/trial-event  - Track trial events
GET  /api/analytics/conversion   - Conversion metrics
POST /api/analytics/feature-usage - Track feature adoption

// Email automation
POST /api/email/trial-sequence  - Trigger email campaigns
