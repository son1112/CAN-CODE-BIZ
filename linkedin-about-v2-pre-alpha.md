**Developing the Future of AI Context Engineering**

can.code is in pre-alpha development of an innovative context engineering platform that will transform how businesses interact with AI. We're building the tools and methodologies to bridge the gap between complex AI capabilities and practical business applications.

## What We're Building:
- **Context Engineering Sandbox** - Interactive tools for designing, testing, and optimizing AI prompts (in development)
- **AI Agent Framework** - Custom AI personalities and specialized business assistants (prototyping phase)  
- **rubberDucky Platform** - Production demo showcasing Next.js 15 with voice integration, real-time streaming, and 13+ AI agents
- **Enterprise Toolkit** - Scalable AI infrastructure and integration solutions (roadmap)

## Our Development Philosophy:
Inspired by rubber duck debugging, we're creating a methodology where effective AI interactions come from systematically thinking through context requirements. Our pre-alpha research focuses on making context engineering accessible and powerful for businesses of all sizes.

## Current Technical Stack:
- Multi-turn dialogue architecture experiments
- Voice-enabled AI with real-time streaming prototypes
- Context optimization research and token efficiency studies
- MongoDB + Next.js production testing environment
- Security and authentication framework development

## Looking Ahead:
We're actively developing solutions for software development teams, business consultants, educators, and creative industries. Our goal is to launch a comprehensive context engineering platform that makes AI interactions more reliable, efficient, and business-focused.
