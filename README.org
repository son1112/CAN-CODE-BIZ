* can.code Community Labs - Learning and Building Together

A community learning organization where we teach and learn AI capabilities together,
creating open-source tools with accessibility-first design principles. Founded on
empathy-first philosophy and the belief that to teach is to learn, we build accessible
technology for underserved communities.

** Philosophy

can.code Community Labs operates on empathy-first learning principles:

*** Technology Accessibility as First-Class Architecture
- Universal design embedded in core technical decisions
- Accessibility testing at every development stage
- Multi-modal interfaces for diverse user needs
- WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA compliance from day one

*** Community-First Organizational Structure
- Learning together prioritizes collective growth over profit extraction
- Transparent sharing of what works and what doesn't builds trust
- Community governance includes marginalized voices
- Recognition-based systems honoring individual differences
- Open-source tools as primary goal, not afterthought

*** Mission: Personal Reality Into Shared Meaning
- Success measured by user confidence and joy, not efficiency
- Technology serves human flourishing
- Systemic change in how society values communication diversity
- Assistive technology for neurodivergent communities

** Foundation & History

can.code Community Labs evolved from a decade of full-stack development experience,
representing an intentional progression from personal experimentation through
professional consulting to community-centered learning and open-source contribution.

**** Domain Identity Evolution
- =lincolnix.org=: Personal brand and technical experimentation
- =beercode.net=: Professional consulting identity
- =can.code=: Community Labs focused on learning together and social impact
- Progression showing intentional growth, not rebranding

This evolution represents not abandonment of previous work, but integration
of experience into community-centered learning, teaching others what we've
learned while learning from those we serve. Every era contributed essential
foundations to can.code's current mission.
