* can.code Research Labs - Empathy-First AI Research

A research organization investigating LLM agentic capabilities through systematic
experimentation with accessibility-first design principles. Founded on empathy-first
philosophy to build accessible intelligence for underserved communities.

** Philosophy

can.code Research Labs operates on empathy-first design principles:

*** Technology Accessibility as First-Class Architecture
- Universal design embedded in core technical decisions
- Accessibility testing at every development stage
- Multi-modal interfaces for diverse user needs
- WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA compliance from day one

*** Service-First Organizational Structure
- Research prioritizes user thriving over profit extraction
- Transparent limitation documentation builds trust
- Community governance includes marginalized voices
- Recognition-based systems honoring individual differences

*** Mission: Personal Reality Into Shared Meaning
- Success measured by user confidence and joy, not efficiency
- Technology serves human flourishing
- Systemic change in how society values communication diversity
- Assistive technology for neurodivergent communities

** Research Projects

*** PRISM - Empathy-First Communication Assistance

Personal Reality Into Shared Meaning: Assistive communication platform born from
neurodivergent lived experience, helping people translate their authentic voice
across different contexts.

**** Three-Layer Philosophy
1. *Technology:* Perspective Refining Intelligent Speech Module
2. *Organization:* People Recognizing Individual Speech Methods
3. *Mission:* Personal Reality Into Shared Meaning

**** Key Features
- Voice preservation with perspective refinement for different audiences
- Recognition over correction paradigm shift
- Layered agent architecture maintaining speaker authenticity
- Community-centered learning from communication patterns
- Accessibility-first technical architecture from day one
- Universal design for neurodivergent and neurotypical users

**** Technology Stack
- Next.js, React, TypeScript
- Claude AI, MongoDB
- AssemblyAI for voice processing
- Accessibility APIs, WCAG compliance tools

**** Impact
Bridges communication gaps through recognition and translation rather than
correction and transformation. Shifts paradigm from "fixing" communication
to honoring individual speech methods.

*** Rubber Ducky - Accessible Voice-AI Research Platform

Experimental research platform investigating voice-AI problem-solving effectiveness
through systematic experimentation with transparent methodology.

**** Research Findings (126+ Implementations)

***** Documented Success Patterns (73% Success Rate)
- Structured problem-solving sessions with clear context
- Technical debugging conversations with specific goals
- Brainstorming within focused domains
- Interview preparation with defined scenarios

***** Identified Limitations (Transparent Documentation)
- Context switching failures in longer conversations
- Degraded performance beyond 45-minute sessions
- Topic drift in unstructured open-ended discussions
- Memory constraints in multi-topic sessions

**** Research Methodology
- Systematic session recording and analysis
- User outcome tracking and validation
- Limitation documentation alongside capabilities
- Academic rigor over marketing claims
- Reproducible methodology for research community

**** Accessibility-First Architecture
- Voice-first interface for diverse communication needs
- Multi-modal input (voice, text, custom agents)
- Universal design principles in UI/UX
- Screen reader optimization and keyboard navigation
- WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA compliance from day one

**** Technology Stack
- Next.js, React, TypeScript
- MongoDB for data persistence
- Claude AI integration
- AssemblyAI real-time streaming
- WebSocket technology
- Mobile-first design

**** Research Contribution
This research contributes to understanding AI system boundaries and informing
future assistive technology development. Results shared openly to advance
the field through honest capability assessment.

** Research Methodology

*** Transparent Limitation Documentation
- Document what doesn't work as rigorously as what does
- Honest capability assessment over marketing claims
- Failure modes analyzed and published
- Success rate calculated with reproducible methodology

*** Academic Rigor
- Systematic experimentation with controlled variables
- Reproducible results and methodology documentation
- Peer-review-ready research processes
- Contributing to broader research community understanding

*** Community-Centered Development
- Marginalized voices in leadership roles
- User thriving prioritized over productivity metrics
- Open collaboration with underserved communities
- Recognition-based systems vs correction-based approaches

** Technology Standards

*** Accessibility Requirements (Mandatory)
- WCAG 2.1 AA minimum, AAA target
- Screen reader compatibility (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Keyboard navigation for all functionality
- Color contrast ratios meeting standards
- Focus indicators and skip links
- ARIA labels and semantic HTML

*** Universal Design Principles
- Multi-modal interfaces (voice, text, visual)
- Flexible interaction methods
- Adaptable to user preferences
- Performance optimization for assistive technologies
- Mobile-first responsive design

*** Development Practices
- Accessibility testing at every stage
- User testing with diverse communities
- Continuous integration with accessibility checks
- Documentation of accessibility features
- Transparent limitation reporting

** Acknowledgments

Built from neurodivergent lived experience with deep gratitude to communities
teaching us that people aren't bad at communicating - they're communicating
in ways that aren't always recognized. Technology should bridge gaps through
translation, not enforce conformity through correction.
