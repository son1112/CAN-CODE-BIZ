This file forces Vercel to do a complete rebuild by creating a unique file
that changes with each commit to bust any aggressive caching.

Current issues:
- SessionHeader component not deploying despite being committed
- PWA icons not deploying despite being generated and committed  
- Vercel appears to be using stale cached builds

Cache-busting strategies:
1. Version bump in package.json
2. .vercelignore to exclude cache directories
3. Build timestamp environment variable
4. This unique timestamp file
