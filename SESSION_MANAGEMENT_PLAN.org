#+TITLE: Session Management Integration Plan
#+AUTHOR: Claude Code
#+DATE: 2025-08-15
#+STARTUP: overview

* Overview

This document outlines the plan to integrate persistent session management into Rubber Ducky Live, bridging the gap between interactive chat and CLI-style batch processing with iterable sessions.

* Current State Analysis

** Interactive Chat System
- Real-time streaming conversations
- Ephemeral message storage
- Immediate AI responses
- No persistence beyond current session

** CLI Session System (rubber-ducky-node)
- Persistent session storage in MongoDB
- Iterable conversations with context preservation
- Batch processing with agent analysis
- Full audit trail and revision history
- Session export and management capabilities

* Proposed Integration Concept

** Core Principle
Every chat conversation becomes a persistent session that can be:
- Continued later (interactive mode)
- Processed in batch (CLI-style agent analysis)
- Iterated with different agents for deeper insights
- Managed and organized for future reference

** Dual Processing Modes

*** Interactive Mode (Current)
- Real-time streaming chat interface
- Immediate AI responses
- Continuous conversation flow
- Live voice input integration

*** Batch Mode (New)
- CLI-style session processing
- Agent-based analysis of conversation context
- Iteration management with different perspectives
- Deep analytical outputs

* Technical Architecture

** Session Data Structure (MongoDB)

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
{
  sessionId: "uuid-v4",
  name: "Auto-generated or user-defined session name",
  createdAt: Date,
  lastAccessedAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date,
  iterationCount: Number,
  
  // Interactive chat data
  messages: [
    {
      id: "message-uuid",
      role: "user|assistant",
      content: "message text",
      timestamp: Date,
      audioMetadata: {...}, // if voice input
      agentUsed: "agent-name"
    }
  ],
  
  // Batch processing iterations
  iterations: [
    {
      iteration: 1,
      processedAt: Date,
      agent: "agent-name",
      input: "combined chat context",
      output: "agent analysis result",
      outputFormat: "txt|json|pdf|markdown|org",
      metadata: {
        processingTime: Number,
        tokenCount: Number,
        userNotes: "optional user context"
      }
    }
  ],
  
  // Organization
  tags: ["work", "debugging", "ideas"],
  isActive: Boolean,
  isArchived: Boolean,
  
  // User context
  createdBy: "user-id",
  lastAgentUsed: "agent-name",
  conversationStarter: "initial message"
}

** API Endpoints

*** Session Management
- =GET /api/sessions= - List user sessions with pagination/filtering
- =GET /api/sessions/:id= - Retrieve specific session with full data
- =POST /api/sessions= - Create new session
- =PUT /api/sessions/:id= - Update session metadata
- =DELETE /api/sessions/:id= - Archive/delete session

*** Iteration Processing
- =POST /api/sessions/:id/iterate= - Process session with selected agent
- =GET /api/sessions/:id/iterations= - List session iterations
- =GET /api/sessions/:id/iterations/:iteration= - Get specific iteration

*** Integration with Chat
- =POST /api/sessions/:id/messages= - Add message to session
- =GET /api/sessions/:id/export= - Export session in various formats

** UI Components Plan

*** Session Browser
- Grid/list view of all user sessions
- Search and filter capabilities
- Sort by date, name, activity
- Quick actions (continue, archive, export)

*** Enhanced Chat Interface
- Session indicator showing current session name
- "Process Session" button to trigger batch analysis
- Session history sidebar (collapsible)
- Save/name session functionality

*** Iteration Manager
- Agent selection for batch processing
- Progress tracking for long-running analysis
- Results viewer with formatting options
- Export capabilities per iteration

*** Session Details View
- Complete chat transcript
- All iterations with outputs
- Session metadata and tags
- Sharing and collaboration features

* Implementation Phases

** Phase 1: Core Session Persistence
- Modify existing chat to automatically create sessions
- Implement basic session CRUD operations
- Update ChatInterface to work with persistent sessions
- Add session naming and metadata

** Phase 2: Session Browser & Management
- Build session list/grid interface
- Implement search and filtering
- Add session organization features (tags, archiving)
- Session export functionality

** Phase 3: Batch Processing Integration
- Integrate with existing CLI agent system
- Build iteration processing API
- Create agent selection interface for batch processing
- Implement progress tracking and result display

** Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Session sharing and collaboration
- Advanced analytics and insights
- Bulk operations on sessions
- Integration with external tools

* CLI Integration Strategy

** Synchronization Approach
- Web sessions stored in same MongoDB collection as CLI sessions
- Use existing rubber-ducky-node session commands where possible
- Ensure compatibility between web and CLI session formats
- Leverage CLI's batch processing engine

** Command Integration
- =rubber-ducky session --web-id <session-id>= to continue web session in CLI
- =rubber-ducky process --session <session-id>= for web-initiated batch processing
- Shared session naming and iteration conventions

* User Experience Flows

** Starting a Conversation
1. User begins chatting (creates session automatically)
2. Auto-generated session name from first message
3. Real-time conversation continues normally
4. Session persisted in background

** Continuing a Session
1. User browses session history
2. Selects previous session to continue
3. Chat interface loads with full context
4. Can continue conversation or process batch

** Processing for Insights
1. During or after chat, user clicks "Process Session"
2. Agent selection interface appears
3. User selects analysis agents and options
4. Batch processing runs with progress indicator
5. Results added as new iteration to session

** Session Management
1. User accesses session browser
2. Can search, filter, and organize sessions
3. Bulk operations (tag, archive, export)
4. Detailed view shows chat + all iterations

* Benefits and Value Proposition

- Never lose important conversations
- Get deeper insights through agent analysis
- Organize and find past discussions easily
- Flexibility between quick chat and deep analysis

** For Development
- Leverages existing CLI infrastructure
- Provides rich data for product insights
- Enables advanced features like collaboration
- Creates pathway for premium features

* Technical Considerations

** Performance
- Implement pagination for session lists
- Lazy loading of session content
- Efficient indexing for search operations
- Background processing for iterations

** Storage

- Compression for old sessions
- Archive strategies for inactive users
- Backup and recovery procedures

** Security
- User isolation of sessions
- Secure sharing mechanisms
