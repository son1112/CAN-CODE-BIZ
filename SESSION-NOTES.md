## ReplayReady Description Correction

**Issue**: The ReplayReady project was incorrectly described as "Modern interface for replay functionality and gaming experiences with clean, intuitive design patterns" in the main website.

**Correction**: Updated the description to accurately reflect ReplayReady as an interview preparation tool:
- Changed description to: "Interview preparation tool that helps candidates practice and improve their interview skills with structured guidance and feedback."
- Updated project tags from Gaming/User Experience/Real-time to Interview Prep/Career Development/Professional Training

**Files Modified**:
- `index.html:1166` - Updated ReplayReady description and tags

**Impact**: 
- Corrects misleading information about the ReplayReady project
- Ensures accurate representation of our interview preparation platform
- Maintains consistency between project descriptions and actual functionality
