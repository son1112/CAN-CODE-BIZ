2. **Industry R&D Teams**: Companies wanting honest AI capability assessment
3. **Graduate Students**: Researchers needing real-world experimental data
4. **Policy Makers**: Decision-makers needing unbiased AI capability analysis

* Communication Strategy Update

** Messaging Transformation
*** Prohibited Language (Business Focus):
- "Revolutionary," "cutting-edge," "game-changing"
- "Production-ready," "enterprise solutions"
- "Transform your business," "maximize ROI"

*** Preferred Language (Research Focus):
- "Investigating," "researching," "documenting"
- "Experimental implementations," "research findings"
- "What works, what doesn't, and why"
- "Capability boundaries," "limitation analysis"

** Content Strategy
*** Website Sections Transformed:
- About → Research Areas: Voice-AI, agentic specialization, multi-agent coordination
- Platform → Methodology: Experimental design, evaluation, transparency
- Portfolio → Experiments: Active research with findings and limitations
- Agents → Research Findings: Capability boundaries across 17+ implementations
- Contact → Community: Research collaboration and academic partnerships

*** Project Universe Integration:
- **Data Reframing**: Business metrics → Research transparency dashboard
- **Dynamic Content**: Live research corpus statistics and experimental status
- **Insight Focus**: Research progress vs. production readiness claims
